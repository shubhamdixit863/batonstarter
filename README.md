# baton-example
Welcome to your new connector!

There are a few operations you are able to do from here:
- `make build` will build the basic connector and check that compilation works.
- `make update-deps` will update all of the local dependencies.
- `make add-dep` will pull down and sync any new dependencies, without updating other dependencies.
- `make lint` will run the linter.
